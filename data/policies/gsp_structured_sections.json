The\nFKC diverts water from Friant Dam and Millerton Reservoir, completed in 1944 on the\nSan Joaquin River, and extends southward a distance of 152 miles through Fresno,\nTulare, and Kern counties. Within Kern County, the FKC extends from approximately\nmile post 122 at the County line near the City of Delano and flows south for\napproximately 30 miles to mile post 152 near Bakersfield (with the FKC terminus at the\nKern River).

Natural recharge occurs by groundwater underflow from adjacent\nsources, precipitation outgaining evapotranspiration in a subbasin, or from natural\nsurface waters flowing into Kern Subbasin. On the other hand, direct recharge is either\nplanned or unplanned application of surface water by unlined conveyance, recharge\nbasins and field application, managed recharge, and spreading/percolation operations.\nFigure 7-5 presents the location of surface water bodies in Kern Subbasin.\nNatural recharge to Kern Subbasin is derived primarily from precipitation and surface\nrunoff from the surrounding watersheds. Natural recharge is highest on the east side\nwhich receives higher precipitation and recharge from the Kern River and other smaller\nstreams from the Sierra Nevada. Natural recharge is lowest on the west side of Kern\nSubbasin which receives less precipitation and lower runoff from the relatively smaller\nwatersheds along the Coast Ranges. Other sources of recharge include ephemeral\nstreams, springs, and seeps from the mountains along the east, southeast, and south\nfault margins of Kern Subbasin.\nSignificant direct recharge to groundwater in Kern Subbasin occurs through water\nbanking and conjunctive use projects as well as unmanaged recharge through natural\nwaterways, unlined basins and canals, regulating (balancing) reservoirs, percolation of\napplied water to crops, and/or fallowed fields that descends below the root zone.\nNumerous sources of water are recharged by various projects, including local surface\nwater (Kern River, Poso Creek, and other drainages) and imported water (SWP and\nCVP).\nThe major areas of direct recharge (facilities and drainages) presented in Figure 7-5\ninclude agricultural land where excess irrigation water percolates below the root zone,\nwastewater treatment spreading areas, and urban drainage spreadin",
